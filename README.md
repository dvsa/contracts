DVSA Contracts
==============
A set of abstractions that define core services provided by the DVSA.

Design Principles
-----------------
* contracts are split by domain, each into their own sub-namespaces;
* contracts are small and consistent sets of PHP interfaces, abstract classes & traits;
* all contracts must have a proven and valid implementation to enter this repository.
